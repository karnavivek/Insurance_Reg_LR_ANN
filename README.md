# Insurance_Reg_LR_ANN
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Insurance Premium Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. 

We can see that out of 20 Features, we see a lot of missing values for following features:

'Health Score': 6.17%
'Customer Feedback': 6.49%
'Number of Dependents': 9.14%
'Credit Score': 11.49%
'Occupation': 29.84%
'Previous Claims': 30.34%
We must be careful by doing some special Imputation techniques because of their sheer amount of missing values!

We also have other Features with missing values but as their percentage is less, we are going for a simple imputation, these are listed below:

'Marital Status': 1.54%
'Age': 1.56%
'Annual Income': 3.75%
